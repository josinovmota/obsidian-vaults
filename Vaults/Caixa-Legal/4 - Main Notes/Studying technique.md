# Studying technique

Given that you have 2 hours for study initially, it’s important to use that time efficiently. Here’s a suggested way to break down your 2-hour study session:

### 1. **Divide the Time into 4 Blocks**
   - **Focus Block 1 (45 minutes):** Start with a deep focus on the most difficult or high-priority topic (e.g., machine learning algorithms, programming). This should be the topic that requires the most mental effort and where you want to see significant progress.
   - **Break (5 minutes):** Take a short break to relax and recharge.
   - **Focus Block 2 (45 minutes):** Move on to another area (e.g., project-based learning or practicing with datasets). This can be something more practical or hands-on, reinforcing concepts with coding or solving problems.
   - **Break (5 minutes):** Another short break to refresh before the last session.
   - **Review & Reflection (15 minutes):** Use this time for reviewing key concepts or summarizing what you’ve learned. You can also use this block for spaced repetition (e.g., using Anki) or reviewing notes.

### 2. **How to Scale This to More Hours**
   - As you increase your study time to 3, 4, 5, or more hours, you can add more focus blocks. Use the same principle of alternating deep focus with breaks:
     - **For 3 hours:** Add a third 45-minute focus block with a 5-minute break, followed by 15 minutes of review.
     - **For 4 hours:** Add a fourth 45-minute block and take a longer break (10-15 minutes) after 2 hours to maintain concentration.
   - The idea is to maintain **intensity** and **focus** during the study blocks, alternating between theory and practical application, while ensuring regular breaks to avoid burnout.

By using focused, time-boxed blocks, you’ll maximize your learning efficiency and make it easier to scale as your study time increases.
